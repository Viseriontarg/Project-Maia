# Project Title: DecisionScope Simulator

## Overview

DecisionScope Simulator is a web-based application designed for Monte Carlo project simulation. It helps project managers and stakeholders understand potential schedule and cost outcomes by considering uncertainties in task durations and risks. The application uses AI to generate detailed project breakdowns from high-level inputs and then simulates thousands of scenarios to provide probabilistic forecasts and identify key risk drivers. The results are presented in a comprehensive Excel report.

## Features

*   **Web-Based Interface**: Provides a user-friendly landing page (HTML) to input initial project parameters (name, type, target cost, target duration).
*   **AI-Powered Project Breakdown**: Leverages the Gemini AI model to transform high-level project inputs into a detailed plan. This plan includes:
    *   Phased task structures.
    *   Task duration estimates using statistical distributions (PERT, Normal, Triangular, Uniform).
    *   Identification of potential project risks with associated probabilities and impact distributions (for both schedule and cost).
*   **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Runs thousands of simulation iterations based on the AI-generated detailed plan. For each iteration, it samples task durations and risk impacts to model a possible project outcome.
*   **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates a multi-sheet Excel report (`.xlsx`) summarizing the simulation results, including:
    *   **Summary Sheet**: Key project overview, user's target cost/duration, AI-generated parameters (team size, daily cost), P-value statistics for total project duration and cost (P10, P50, P90, P95), top risk drivers (by impact on days and cost), and a histogram of simulated project durations.
    *   **Inputs & Assumptions Sheet**: Detailed tables of the tasks (with their duration parameters and distributions) and risks (with probabilities and impact parameters/distributions) used in the simulation, as generated by the AI.
    *   **Distribution Data Sheet**: A sample of simulated total durations and costs from the Monte Carlo runs.
*   **Dynamic Input Validation**: The backend validates user inputs for project name, type, base cost, and base duration to ensure data integrity.
*   **CORS Enabled**: Allows for easier integration if the frontend and backend are served from different origins.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following key files:

*   `app.py`: The main Flask web application. It handles incoming requests, serves the landing page, validates user input, orchestrates calls to the AI module, simulation engine, and report generator, and returns the simulation report to the user.
*   `ai_breakdown.py`: Contains the logic for interacting with the Gemini AI model. It takes high-level project information (name, type, cost, duration) and prompts the AI to generate a detailed, structured project plan suitable for Monte Carlo simulation. This includes defining phases, tasks with various statistical duration parameters, and risks with probabilistic impacts.
*   `simulation.py`: The core Monte Carlo simulation engine. It takes the detailed project plan, simulates numerous project scenarios by sampling from the defined statistical distributions for task durations and risk impacts, calculates critical path durations, and aggregates the results to provide probabilistic forecasts of project duration and cost.
*   `report_generator.py`: Responsible for creating a comprehensive multi-sheet Excel report from the simulation inputs and results. It formats the data into readable tables and includes charts for better visualization.
*   `templates/decisonscope-landing.html`: An HTML file that serves as the frontend for the application. It provides a form for users to input project details and initiate the simulation.
*   `README.md`: This file, providing documentation for the project.

## Setup and Usage

Follow these steps to set up and run the DecisionScope Simulator:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python 3.7+ installed.
    *   `pip` (Python package installer) installed.
    *   Access to a Gemini API key.

2.  **Clone the Repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

3.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
    ```txt
    Flask
    Flask-CORS
    pandas
    openpyxl
    numpy
    scipy
    google-generativeai
    python-dotenv
    ```
    Then, install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your Gemini API key:
    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    Replace `"YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual API key.

6.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The application will typically start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

7.  **Using the Simulator:**
    *   Open your web browser and navigate to the application URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`).
    *   You will see the DecisionScope landing page.
    *   Fill in the project details:
        *   **Project Name:** A descriptive name for your project.
        *   **Project Type:** Select from predefined types (e.g., Software Development, Construction Project). The AI uses this to tailor the project breakdown.
        *   **Base Cost (Optional):** Your target or estimated base cost for the project.
        *   **Base Duration (Optional):** Your target or estimated base duration for the project in days.
    *   Click the "Run Simulation with Input" button.
    *   The application will process the request, which may take a few moments as it involves an AI API call and the simulation runs.
    *   Once complete, a success message will appear, along with the path to the generated Excel report (e.g., `generated_reports/YourProjectName_simulation_report.xlsx`).
    *   You can find the report in the `generated_reports` directory within your project folder.

## Potential Future Enhancements

*   **Advanced Risk Modeling**: Implement more sophisticated risk correlation options, risk mitigation strategies, and sensitivity analysis on risks.
*   **Cost Breakdown**: Allow for more granular cost inputs (e.g., resource costs, fixed costs, variable costs) instead of a single daily team cost.
*   **Enhanced UI/UX**: Improve the web interface with more interactive elements, real-time feedback, and potentially visualizations of the simulation results directly in the browser.
*   **Task Dependency Visualization**: Add a feature to visualize task dependencies (e.g., Gantt chart or network diagram) from the AI-generated plan.
*   **Scenario Comparison**: Allow users to run multiple simulations with different input parameters and compare the results side-by-side.
*   **Cloud Deployment**: Provide instructions or scripts for deploying the application to cloud platforms.
*   **API Endpoints for Integration**: Expose API endpoints for the simulation engine so other tools can integrate with it programmatically.
*   **Database Integration**: Store simulation results and project plans in a database for historical analysis and tracking.
